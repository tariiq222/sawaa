 * Actions come from `@sawaa/shared/constants` (`PERMISSION_ACTIONS`),
 * with the additional CASL-only literal `'all'` reserved for SUPER_ADMIN.
 *
 * OWNER is the per-org top-level role (`MembershipRole.OWNER`). It carries
 * everything ADMIN does, PLUS exclusive control over `Billing`, `Plan`, and
 * `Subscription` — the three subjects that govern subscription state and
 * platform billing. ADMIN handles day-to-day clinic ops but cannot change
 * the plan, refund a platform invoice, or cancel the subscription.
 *
 * Super-admin platform access is gated by `User.isSuperAdmin` (boolean),
 * NOT by this map. The `SUPER_ADMIN` row here is a transitional fallback
 * for in-flight tokens that still carry the legacy `role` claim.
